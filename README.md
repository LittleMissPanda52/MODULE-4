# MODULE-4
We're going to complete the difficulties assigned to us in this last module! It includes burning tokens and minting, transferring, redeeming, and checking!

# Description
Developed in Remix Ethereum, a programming language used for creating tokens and other NFTs, this module is the last oneâ€”the final ETH AVAX! As OpenZepplin provides you with a GitHub that generates your first code automatically without you having to type it in, below are a few scripts that can work wonderfully in your advantage. All it takes is a bit extra coding and minting! completed really quickly.

# Getting Started
Launch Remix: Open the Remix Ethereum IDE and click the "+" symbol to start a new file in the left-hand file explorer window. Paste the code for the contract into the editor.

Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab located in the sidebar on the left. Choose the Solidity compiler version (~0.8.18 in this example) that corresponds to the pragma declaration in your contract. Then, to compile the contract and add features like mining, redeeming, transferring, and balancing your token, click the "Compile DegenToken.sol" button!

# Executing the Code
When you're finished, use Ctrl + S to check your code for inconsistencies. If there are none, you're done! You're on to the next phase now! On the left sidebar, select the "Deploy & run transactions" tab. Click "Deploy" after choosing the "DegenToken" contract from the drop-down menu. Verify the transaction, and the contract need to be activated shortly after!
